## Why I Created the Framework

In my career as CTO and technology consultant, I’ve worked on countless software systems across industries, each with unique challenges. But one problem stands out as universal: a breakdown in communication between stakeholders and implementation teams.

Stakeholders often focus on business needs, deadlines, and outcomes, while implementation teams think in terms of technical challenges, feasibility, and trade-offs. These two perspectives rarely align, leading to frustration, misalignment, and missed opportunities. The F6 Framework was created to bridge this gap.

This framework defines six foundational aspects of software development: Volatility, Capability, Dependency, Security, Resilience, and Investment. These domains provide a structured way to hold conversations, find common ground, and unlock the trapped potential I’ve seen in so many stalled or misaligned projects. It’s a tool to foster understanding and collaboration, helping teams achieve the outcomes everyone is striving for.
