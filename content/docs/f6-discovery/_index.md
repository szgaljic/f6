## Todo

- Constraints

- **Event Storming:** A collaborative workshop technique for mapping out system events, workflows, and domain boundaries, enabling teams to visualize where changes are likely to occur.
- **Story Mapping:** A visual method to break down user journeys and feature sets, focusing on user needs and identifying areas of uncertainty or variability.
- **Journey Mapping:** Mapping the end-to-end customer experience to uncover key interactions and dependencies, especially useful in customer-facing systems.
- **Mind Mapping:** Brainstorming and organizing ideas around workflows or features to identify relationships and areas that may evolve.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Identifying bounded contexts and domains to align software architecture with business operations, revealing areas of volatility tied to domain boundaries.
