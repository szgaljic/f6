The F6 Framework provides a structured, holistic approach to building software with intention, with thoughtful communication and alignment across six core principles.

## Volatility

_Navigating change with precision and purpose._

It’s been said that the only constant in life is change. Software is no different; it’s a depreciating asset that must be updated, altered, and maintained to stay effective.

The **Volatility** foundation emphasizes the balance between rapid progress and thoughtful precision. It acknowledges the duality of software development: the need to deliver impactful results quickly while ensuring those results are built with the care and precision required for their intended lifetime. 

This aspect recognizes a sliding scale: are you building for the "here and now," accepting the potential for more significant rewrites later, or investing in a foundation that supports seamless evolution over time? Both approaches have their place, depending on the system’s goals, constraints, and maturity. [Software is never truly "done," and every decision made today influences how effectively it can evolve tomorrow.](https://insights.jahnelgroup.com/software-is-a-depreciating-asset-why-your-software-is-never-done)

Operating with intention involves trade-offs, as acting without thoughtful deliberation or clear purpose can create misalignment between stakeholders and the tech team. 

## Capability

_Ensuring the software delivers its intended purpose with precision and value._

At its core, software exists to solve problems, meet needs, and deliver value to users and stakeholders. **Capability** represents the foundation of functionality—the workflows, features, and solutions that define the software’s purpose. 

This foundation emphasizes delivering the right functionality, at the right time, to the right users. It's about carefully considering the purpose of the software and prioritizing it's feature sets. Capability also underscores the importance of intentionality. Adding unnecessary features or poorly implementing required ones can dilute focus, introduce technical debt, and create frustration for users. 

A system that fulfills its purpose with precision and clarity becomes not just functional, but invaluable. 

## Integration

_Harmonizing internal and external components to create cohesive, effective systems._

No software system exists in isolation. Every application relies on an ecosystem of tools, libraries, platforms, and services, each playing a role in its capability and success. **Integration** focuses on strategically managing this ecosystem—deciding what to build, what to buy, and how to seamlessly connect all the pieces.

This foundational aspect is about understanding the core identity of your software: what makes it unique and mission-critical? This identity informs decisions about ownership versus reliance. 

Each trade-off requires deep consideration—relying on third-party solutions can accelerate development and offload complexity but introduces risks, such as vendor lock-in, dependency vulnerabilities, or misalignment with future needs. 

Ultimately, Integration challenges teams to think holistically about the ecosystem their software inhabits.

## Security

_Protecting systems and users with vigilance and intent._

In an interconnected world, where data flows freely and software powers critical systems, security is not optional—it’s expected. Security is about more than defense; it’s about trust. Users, stakeholders, and organizations depend on software that safeguards their data, privacy, and operations against ever-evolving threats.

The **Security** foundation emphasizes building protection into every layer of the system, from the earliest stages of design. It recognizes a continuum of risk and investment. Some systems demand rigorous compliance with the highest security standards, while others may tolerate more lenient measures, balancing security needs against time, cost, and complexity. 

Regardless of the scale, security must never be an afterthought.

## Resilience

_Building systems that endure, adapt, and perform under all conditions._

Software systems are constantly tested—not just by users but by the unpredictable forces of failure, demand, and change. **Resilience** is the foundation that ensures a system remains available, reliable, and high-performing, even in the face of adversity. It encompasses the non-functional qualities that are often invisible until they fail but are critical for delivering a world-class user experience.

At its core, Resilience is about engineering for the unexpected. Systems must be intentionally designed to handle these situations without compromising on availability or performance. Teams must balance these considerations with cost and complexity, tailoring their approach to the system’s unique requirements.

Resilience challenges teams to think beyond functionality, embedding robustness, availability, and performance into the core of their design.

## Investment

_Aligning time, money, and resources to deliver value with intent._

Every software project operates within constraints. Time, money and scope must all be carefully managed to achieve success. **Investment** is the foundation that brings these realities into focus, ensuring teams align their ambitions with the resources available.

This foundation emphasizes the holistic cost of building software. How many people are needed? Are they founding members with equity, full-time employees or contractors? What expertise is required, and does your team already have it, or will hiring or training be necessary? Beyond the team, there’s the cost of infrastructure, licensing, and third-party services. Balancing these operational costs with long-term sustainability is critical to avoid overspending or creating bottlenecks for future growth.

Investment also underscores trade-offs. How much time can you afford to spend on perfecting features or performance? Is a lean MVP sufficient to meet market demands, or does your system require a more comprehensive approach? Every choice about scope, resources, and timelines impacts the system’s trajectory ability to achieve its goals.
