## Overview

_Harmonizing internal and external components to create cohesive, effective systems._

No software system exists in isolation. Every application relies on an ecosystem of tools, libraries, platforms, and services, each playing a role in its capability and success. **Dependency** focuses on strategically managing this ecosystem—deciding what to build, what to buy, and how to seamlessly connect all the pieces.

This foundational aspect is about understanding the core identity of your software: what makes it unique and mission-critical? This identity informs decisions about ownership versus reliance. 

Each trade-off requires deep consideration—relying on third-party solutions can accelerate development and offload complexity but introduces risks, such as vendor lock-in, dependency vulnerabilities, or misalignment with future needs. 

Ultimately, Dependency challenges teams to think holistically about the ecosystem their software inhabits.
