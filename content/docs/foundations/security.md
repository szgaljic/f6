## Overview

_Protecting systems and users with vigilance and detail._

In an interconnected world, where data flows freely and software powers critical systems, security is not optional—it’s expected. Security is about more than defense; it’s about trust. Users, stakeholders, and organizations depend on software that safeguards their data, privacy, and operations against ever-evolving threats.

The **Security** foundation emphasizes building protection into every layer of the system, from the earliest stages of design. It recognizes a continuum of risk and investment. Some systems demand rigorous compliance with the highest security standards, while others may tolerate more lenient measures, balancing security needs against time, cost, and complexity. 

Regardless of the scale, security must never be an afterthought.
