## Overview

_Aligning time, money, and resources to deliver valuable solutions._

Every software project operates within constraints. Time, money and scope must all be carefully managed to achieve success. **Investment** is the foundation that brings these realities into focus, ensuring teams align their ambitions with the resources available.

This foundation emphasizes the holistic cost of building software. How many people are needed? Are they founding members with equity, full-time employees or contractors? What expertise is required, and does your team already have it, or will hiring or training be necessary? Beyond the team, there’s the cost of infrastructure, licensing, and third-party services. Balancing these operational costs with long-term sustainability is critical to avoid overspending or creating bottlenecks for future growth.

Investment also underscores trade-offs. How much time can you afford to spend on perfecting features or performance? Is a lean MVP sufficient to meet market demands, or does your system require a more comprehensive approach? Every choice about scope, resources, and timelines impacts the system’s trajectory ability to achieve its goals.
