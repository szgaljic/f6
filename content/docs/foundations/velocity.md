## Background

_Moving with purpose and precision to deliver lasting impact._

**Velocity and Accuracy** emphasizes the balance between rapid progress and thoughtful precision. It acknowledges the duality of software development: the need to deliver impactful results quickly while ensuring those results are built with the care and precision required for their intended lifetime. 

This aspect recognizes a sliding scale: are you building for the "here and now," accepting the potential for more significant rewrites later, or investing in a foundation that supports seamless evolution over time? Both approaches have their place, depending on the system’s goals, constraints, and maturity.
