## Overview

_Ensuring the software delivers its intended purpose with precision and value._

At its core, software exists to solve problems, meet needs, and deliver value to users and stakeholders. **Capability** represents the foundation of functionality—the workflows, features, and solutions that define the software’s purpose. 

This foundation emphasizes delivering the right functionality, at the right time, to the right users. It's about carefully considering the purpose of the software and prioritizing it's feature sets. Capability also underscores the importance of intentionality. Adding unnecessary features or poorly implementing required ones can dilute focus, introduce technical debt, and create frustration for users. 

A system that fulfills its purpose with precision and clarity becomes not just functional, but invaluable.
