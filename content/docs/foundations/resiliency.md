## Overview

_Building systems that endure, adapt, and perform under all conditions._

Software systems are constantly tested—not just by users but by the unpredictable forces of failure, demand, and change. **Resiliency** is the foundation that ensures a system remains available, reliable, and high-performing, even in the face of adversity. It encompasses the non-functional qualities that are often invisible until they fail but are critical for delivering a world-class user experience.

At its core, Resiliency is about engineering for the unexpected. Systems must be intentionally designed to handle these situations without compromising on availability or performance. Teams must balance these considerations with cost and complexity, tailoring their approach to the system’s unique requirements.

Resiliency challenges teams to think beyond functionality, embedding robustness, availability, and performance into the core of their design.
